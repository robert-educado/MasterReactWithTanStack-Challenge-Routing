# Challenge - Routing

In this challenge you practice using TanStack Router, by creating routes, loading data, using the <Link> element for navigation, and more.

1. Start server

Start integrated terminal and navigate to folder containing server:

`cd server`

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Starta server:

`npm run dev`

Open http://localhost:8000/products in browser - verify you're getting products returned in JSON.

If you're using VS Code and have extension Thunder Client installed, you can import thunder-client.json
which contains pre-configured requests.

`cd client`

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Start server:

`npm run dev`

Open http://localhost:3000 and verify that the start page displays with only 
a site header visible, no products are displayed.

You are ready to take on the challenge!
